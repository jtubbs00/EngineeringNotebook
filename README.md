## Week of 11/16/2020-11/20/2020
This week I learned a little bit about coding, but I am still stuck. I don't remember much from last year, becasue school stopped right as we were starting with the Arduino. I tried looking at examples on the arduino site but still don't really understand it. So, I haven't finished anything this week.
